# Safety Re-Alignment of Fine-tuned Language Models through Model Fusion
![Alt text](overview.png)

## 1. Prepare models fine-tuning on downstream tasks 

Chinese, Hindi, English, Code, and Math tasks.

## 3. Train a safe mask for indicating a safe region in the weight space

## 4. Evaluation safety for realignment of fine-tuned models
### (1) single task fine-tuned models
````

````
### (2) fusion model fine-tuned on multi-task datasets
